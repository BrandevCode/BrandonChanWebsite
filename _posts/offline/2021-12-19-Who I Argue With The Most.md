<span style="font-size: 21px">*I like to learn from the arguments of others*</span>. Often, when others were arguing, I would be there in the background as a spectator. I would presume that people would take this to mean I didn't want to be involved, but that's not the case. I'm observing; I want to imagine what I would do if I were one of them or how I could prevent the conflict. I used to work as a cashier. And they drilled the mindset that if a person with a weapon is threatening me, do whatever they say and "don't be a superhero." This rule makes sense as my life is not worth the amount of cash the thief would be stealing. However, I ask myself, what if I saw the perfect moment where they put down their weapon next to me, and they got distracted? Should I act upon it and try to take the gun or knife away? Maybe there is a world where I can construct the right words to say to the intruder and calm them, so everyone is safe? I tend to ruminate over these situations as I fear that one day it might happen. And it did.

On one of my transit rides, there was an argument between two males in their late 20s, early 30s. They were sitting away from each other at the back of the bus. I was sitting only a couple of feet away. I glanced at them and they didn't look like the most friendly people, so I got nervous. Suddenly, they started punching each other in the back seat, and I panicked. I first checked to see if anyone had a knife or a gun. They didn't have any. As they continued to be rowdy, I went towards them and tried my best to push the two away from each other. They finally separated, though they continued to argue. I'm not entirely sure what their argument was about, but I think it was because one of them was too close to other's personal space. Something very petty, but I can imagine their argument grew because their ego told them to fight back. Before I left the bus at the next stop, one of the guys looked at me and asked, "you see how ridiculous the other guy is being, right?". I shook my head in disappointment and said, "but you're causing the rest of us on the bus to be scared right now." I believed they were both being ridiculous, though I also don't blame either of them. Maybe they both were having horrible days like a family member or friend passing away, and they were holding in their anger until this moment made them blow up. I don't know the full context of their story, so I always think it's best to give others the benefit of the doubt as I can often relateâ€”those moments where I wasn't able to control my emotions and act rationally. I understand how they must have felt, but that does not excuse their actions. We can blame others for the situation that we're in, but our actions are our responsibility in the end. Just like how I jumped in to stop a potentially dangerous fight, one could argue that I shouldn't have tried to be a hero. I was putting my life in danger and should have stayed back. I disobeyed what I learned as a cashier and would probably do it again.

Everyone has an ego; in that instance, the two rowdy individuals both thought they were right in their argument, but I imagine that they regret their actions. I was also acting on my ego to prove the lesson "not to be a hero" wrong and that I can and should be a hero in some circumstances. Being selfless is tough and maybe foolish to many people who view the world where only those who run away survive. However, I would rather live in a world where everyone was more selfless than selfish. The difference between their ego and mine is that I was self-aware of my actions. I did not have my emotions clouding my judgement and was willing to take a risk to prevent the conflict. I already had debates with myself about what I should do in these situations, and I will continue to go back and forth with myself to find the answer to the question, "when is the right time to take the risk and be a hero?" I learn to make the right decisions through the constant questions I ask myself. So will you be the type of person who reacts to situations when it arises, or are you prepared to argue with yourself. "Am I doing something I won't regret?"
